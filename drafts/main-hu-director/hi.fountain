In background A woman in scooter is crashing at everything. first a truck, then a still car, then road divider and each time she is one screaming at them and driving again. ATHARVA and NEERAJ notice her and get frustrated.

NEERAJ
Yaar, aaj kal ke ladkiyon ko dekh, driving aati nahi aur phir bhi scooter chalane nikal padti hain! License kahan se mil jaata hai inko? Main toh 5 saal se driving test de raha hoon, 50 baar fail ho gaya hoon, aur yeh log bina dimag ke license leke nikal padte hain! Matlab, koi toh batao, yeh kya scam chal raha hai, main test mein fail ho raha hoon aur yeh log sidha license leke, traffic mein rocket ki tarah daud rahe hain!

ATHARVA nodding and agreeing.

ATHARVA
Ha na, yaha koi 'Fast and Furious' ki shooting chal rahi jo ye aisa drive karte hai. Main in logo ko 'Fast and Furious 11' kya 'Race 4' main bhi cast na karo.

NEERAJ get angry that he is still here.

NEERAJ
Tu ja aur cigarette le kar aa! Kya logo judge karta rehta hai? Tujhe school main kisi ne nahi sikhaya ki kisi ko judge karna buri baat hai?

ATHARVA went to buy cigarette while NEERAJ waiting for him.

PETROL PUMP ATTENDANT

INT. Hospital - HALLWAY - CONTINUES

ATHARVA paces back and forth, his face showing a mix of pain, anxiety, and the aftermath of his friends’ stupidity. He glances at the door to the OPERATION THEATRE every few seconds. An OLD COUPLE walks by slowly, clearly intrigued by his nervous energy. The OLD WOMAN, with a kind smile, approaches

OLD WOMAN
Are beta, chinta mat karo. Usko kuch nahi hoga. Jab mera pahli baar tha, ye bhi... (points to the OLD MAN with a fond chuckle) ...aise hi pareshaan the.

ATHARVA, thrown by the sudden interaction, looks at them, confused.

ATHARVA
Matlab aapka bhi—

The OLD MAN steps forward, placing a reassuring hand on ATHARVA’s shoulder.

OLD MAN
Beta, chinta mat karo. Khud ko zyada stress mat do. First time sab ke saath aisa hota hai.

ATHARVA
Sabke saath?

OLD WOMAN
Haan beta, sab normal hai. Mera matlab hai, pehli baar mein sabko thoda darr lagta hai. Par dekhna, sab kuch theek ho jayega. Himmat se kaam lo!

ATHARVA shifts uncomfortably, still clueless. The OLD MAN nods sagely

OLD MAN
Bilkul. Jab humara pehla tha na, toh main toh seedha behosh ho gaya tha! Tum toh kaafi strong lagte ho, wah wah! Aaj kal ke ladke bhi bohot himmat wale hai.

ATHARVA blinks, trying to connect the dots. Suddenly, it starts to dawn on him what the couple might be thinking.

ATHARVA
Aap log keh rahe ho... yeh sab... delivery...?

The OLD WOMAN pats his arm reassuringly.

OLD WOMAN
Haan beta! Tumhare jaisa pyaara pati kaise pareshaan ho sakta hai? Tumhare liye bhi bahut badi baat hai! ki aaj tum baap banne wale ho.

ATHARVA opens his mouth to speak, trying to clear up the massive misunderstanding.

ATHARVA
Arre nahi, meri baat toh suniye, yeh sab—

Before he can finish, the OLD MAN pulls out a box of sweets from his bag, as if they were prepared for this very moment.

OLD MAN
Nahi beta, ab toh muh meetha karna zaroori hai! Mubarak ho!

He shoves a piece of sweet into ATHARVA’s mouth while the OLD WOMAN beams at him. They both start walking away, waving enthusiastically.

OLD WOMAN
Sab kuch acha hoga! Humari duaayein tumhare saath hain!

ATHARVA, still with the sweet in his mouth, and trying to speak.

ATHARVA
(sweet still in his mouth)

Then DOCTOR comes out of operation theatre and removing his gloves.
ATHARVA swallow the sweet.
