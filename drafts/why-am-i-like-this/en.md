## Start
Do you ever get feeling that you were not raised normal, like all the other kids in the world and that has greatly influenced you and your decisions, made you feel like you not compatible with this world.

I do feel this most of time, specially when I feel lonely or fail to do basic task that all normal people can do or when my words get misunderstood and mistaken. All those moments make me feel hollow inside and sounds of **unaliving** myself get echoes. But I try to live, hoping that someday I won't feel hollow, I won't feel out of place or feeling that i don't belong here.

Maybe you feel that too, maybe you don't or maybe you are great at pretending you are not. I am not good at pretending. whenever I try to pretend I feel fake and more like I am not lying to them but myself.

It's a **strange paradox**, I can't fit in because I am not like the others and only way to fit in is by pretending but I can't pretend, it's not something I can't do and live like everything is fine when I am breaking. If I can't pretend, I can't fit in, does that mean I will always be alone, always out of place.

It creates this loop where I feel stuck between wanting connection and not knowing how to get it without sacrificing my identity.

Whenever I see group of people I know, talking and laughing in a same room where I am at corner, alone by myself. It made be feel how disconnected I am from people. Even if try to engage with people it doesn't go well, I would be standing there as rock. If I try to say something, people won't understand it, misunderstand it or just don't know what I am talking about or I don't know what they are talking about and every attempt to connect ends up leaving me more isolated.

Let's start from start shall we. So you get better understanding what really has happened and hope that you won't misunderstand me and probably answer '*Why am I like this*'.

## Before My Birth
1 year before my birth my parents were married. I always tell people that it was a love marriage because both are different states and I don't need explain any further.

It was not a love rather paying back the favour or just a trying or I don't know what to name.

### Mom
My mom is from small village in south and she is **illiterate** and already been to married to someone but things didn't go well and she just left him.

Since marriage was not legal there was no divorce as well, and it was village, what do you expect.

She was living and working with her parents until her friend took her to capital city and she spend few months. she attempted to come back home all alone but due **illiteracy** she boarded into wrong train and that's where she met my father for first time.

### Father

My father weren't quite young during marriage, he was in middle age at that time. He wasn't married before but he did try to get married but failed. Or maybe I don't have enough information because all I could find from him and relatives that he attempted to marry before but always fail and he always claimed to have "**mangala dosha**" ("**mars defect**") and called himself **Manglik** (Yes, my father believes in astrology).

During that time my father used to deliver critical ship part and just was returning from the delivery.

He boarded in same train that my mother mistook for her home and had seat where my mother was sitting.

## When both boarded on same train
To keep things small and not make you bored, I will skip and fast-forward.

My father made my mother realized that she boarded wrong train but then he promised her that he will take her to her home safely.

He made call to his **boss** asking for leaves (with lies of course). First he took her to his home where my mother met with my **uncle** (father's brother) **aunt** (father's brother's wife).

Then they leave for my mother's village. Upon arrival my **grandma** (mom's mother) and **uncles** (mom's brothers) were happy and crying as they thought they lost her.

Next day many **villagers** came to see my father as it was first time in their village that someone from city bring back a girl from their village safely as they only heard bad thing happening with village girls.

My father came back after few months when my aunt (father's brother's wife) suggest him marry the woman he brought with few months ago.

He put that proposal in front of grandma (mom's mother) and everyone accepted it.

Both got married but they had different intentions behind marriage.

My father married, thought that she is naive village girl and I saved her, she would be grateful and do everything I will say.

My mother married, thinking he just an old man who will die eventually or I leave left him after few months.

And she would but she didn't because I was born.
She didn't expect that she was pregnant and got to know that along with everyone.

Whenever she is **drunk** (yes, my mother is **alcoholic**) and had verbal fight with my father, she say to that she would have left but stopped because of me, she even said if she knew that she was pregnant before anyone else, she would **aborted me** secretly.

Now you tell me, is this love marriage? Because I don't think so yet I claim because that's easy it is than explaining this monstrosity.

## Birth
You probably don't remember your own birth (I hope you don't otherwise you would be divine) and neither do I. But your parents, relatives must have told you stories what really has happened. They must have told you everyone was happy, each of your family members hold you one by one and might kiss your forehead, introduce themselves to you even you are not in state of understanding anything.

If there was some drama, maybe someone or nurse might misplaced you and your family members search and ceased whole hospital without warrant. Or someone mistook you for their child.

If you born were in a house who was expecting a son but instead got daughter then there must be a huge conflict but during that time at least your mom fought for you or I hope so fought for you and hold you dearly.

But when I was born, within a few hours after my birth a **conspiracy** was created, that I will be replaced with another child. conspirers or conspirators were none other than my own mother and her bed neighbour who also recently gave birth to a daughter.

The plan was that, during the night when everyone was sleeping, they would **exchange** me with their daughter as my mother wanted a daughter and that other woman wanted a son and it was a foolproof plan. No one from family members knew whether it son or daughter, there were no CCTV in whole hospital and neither there was kind of sticker, label or tag that could help to distinguish babies neither some kind of note or database.

I would have been replaced but it wasn't for my grandmother (my Mom's mother). Despite no one was allowed near me or my mother from outside.
Grandma sat on the floor and from a distance constantly watch over me. She didn't even slept or took a nap. Whole night she was there looking over me till morning when whole family was allowed to visit and that's why their plan failed.

Maybe I should thanks my Grandma but I don't know how she will reach if she get to knew that her daughter had a plan to exchange me.

If you are wondering how do I know about this, my mother told, not only me but most of my family members, my uncle and aunt also know about this story and she proudly would share this story at family gathering and laugh like this was some kind of joke.

I was a child when I heard this story for the first time but I didn't care much that time but now whenever I think about it or hear that story again, it feels like a stab straight through heart and it's hurts to even think and feel about it.

## Birth to 5 years 
Due to **infantile amnesia** I don't have memories of my childhood. The few fragments I have often show few moments where I was with my uncle and aunt on trip or that shopkeeper giving me free candy.

The fragmented moment when my father took me in boat few times. Playing in garden with my mother. Running around and collecting random stuff. 

Was I actually happy in those moments or it just my **reconstructive memory**? I don't know, it doesn't feel reconstructive, not every part seems reconstructive.

I have seen the picture of my childhood and I seem happy there.

There more pictures as my parents claim but either got lost or stolen.

According to my parents, I once caught **chickenpox** and they didn't had enough money for treatment. The relatives and other family members didn't help us. That when a shopkeeper near my home paid for my treatment. 

He the same one who gave me free candy and we still talk to each other, even though he no longer have shop near my home and shifted to another city and yet we still talk and meet sometime.

I was probably 4 when I got admission on first grade.

## 5 years to 10 years
I have some clear of memories of this period.
Probably because that's when I actually started to feel and understand **downfall of my life**.

That time I realised that my parents were fighting with each other. I don't have any memory of it being physically fight, it was only verbal but there is one instance when my mother throw food at my father's face because he demand to be fed from her hands.
That's when I felt something strange that I can't describe due to it being distant memory.
After the fight all of came outside and then they locked the door and went somewhere while I sat by the locked door waiting for them.

I felt something during that, I don't know what that was, probably first time feeling true sadness or first time feeling lonely, I can't recall correctly because the memory is distant but it wasn't good that's for sure.

I was punished for every mistakes no matter how **insignificant** that was without realising I was just a child.
I once fall got my clothes dirty and I was beaten for it.
I once lost few coins when my mother ordered me bought something for her. I am not sure if I actually lost few coins or shopkeeper (other one) used my innocence to get extra money or the price of the product was more than what she thought. Whatever the case I was thrown out to find those lost coin until rain came and I was allowed back.

At one instance, she send to bought something for her and said I can have some coin for myself. I went to shopkeeper (other one) and bought what my mom wanted and ask him to give some candy and he gave me 4.

I was happy that I got 4 but when I reached home, first I got scold because I didn't brought the changes. That's when I realised that shopkeeper used all left over money for candy and gave me 4 instead of 1.

Yes, I was beaten for this, she went that far that she used metal wire tongs and gave me **burn scar**. She put that tongs on flame and then directly placed on **left lumbar**. If you lift my from left, you can still the burn scars in C shape.

There are some conflict in memories, according to my mother, she gave me burn scars because I refused to eat food but in my memory it was a punishment for the mistake I made. Whatever the case it, I don't know if it justifiable what she did.

And yes, that's another joke to laugh at family gathering and yes everyone knows about those burn scars.

My father didn't had much role in my childhood. He was mostly absent due to his work but eventually he left that job and got a work that doesn't include staying away from family.

But things didn't well for me. I still got beaten, sometimes by both. Yes there been some rare cases one saved me from another but that's only when one of them though I was not wrong otherwise it was inevitable for me get beaten by either of them.

I wasn't good at studies at start, neither their teaching methods. In school you would get hit with thick wooden stick just because you didn't remembered your tables correctly and in private classes you get **molten wax** from candle on your skin because you didn't do their homework.

I had friends before I was put in first grade, in fact some of my friends also got admission in same school in same grade but their behaviour towards me has changed.

We used to play together but since school they treated me like they don't even know me. They avoided me like something was wrong with me. whenever I approach them to play, they pushed me away like I was kid among the group of big people. That's when I felt being outcasted for the first time and probably deceptions and betrayals as well.

I had no friends because I was being outcasted, they always made me feel like I am not from their league and that's when I started learn to live alone.

## 10 years to 15 years
I was going towards teenage years and you might thinking things would have changed, it would be better but it was not.

My school never was changed and I spend 10 years in same school with same batch and their behaviour towards me never changed, not even at the end of school.

Only things that changed was the hormones in my body and they intensified my feelings and emotions and bring new feelings and emotions.

My father didn't allowed me to go out and meet with people, I couldn't even go to playground without either of them come with me. He was paranoid that something will happen to me or I might learn bad habits from bad people. My father used to read newspaper a lot everyday and child getting missing or drug were more common to heard that time.

I was locked in my home same as **Rapunzel** was locked in her tower by her **mother Gothel** or in my case my own father with excuses that world is bad place and that they know best.

I was still treated as outcast in my school and I couldn't make friends. Some did became, mostly those were transferred into our school but eventually they would do same as everyone else or get transferred to another school.

I was given a name, **mad/crazy scientist**.
Mad/Crazy because I exhibited behaviour as someone mad or crazy would show, like laughing and smiling while doing your own things when alone or throwing tantrum over small issues and anger issues.

Now if i think about, I wasn't crazy or mad, it was the outcome of what they did to me, because now I don't exhibits these behaviour. I no longer have anger issue or throw tantrum over small issues (Though I do get emotional or overthink on small issues).

Scientist because that's what interested me. Unlike them or what considered norm, I didn't talk about WWE, cricket, cartoons or movies with other people, I used to talk about space, aliens, nature, science fiction and stuff. I used to admire scientist a lot and thus given name scientist with mad/crazy as prefix.

I wasn't great at study nor I was some kind of nerd or geek, it just that I found science admiring, adoring and delighting when you learn and tell people how things work and what actually they are.

School was about to end, and I thought things would change and it will be different, but was I right about it?

## 15 years to 18 years
The school has ended now I realised how many friends I had.

I thought I will admission in college and would have new start.

Wish I could tell you that your future's nothing but amazing, That's just not the case, and I guess I just don't know how to say this.

Due to **financial issues**, I could not get admission in college but still I completed my education till 12th grade through open schooling. That mean I never get to experience what college feel neither I got the chance make new friends.

There was girl in our private classes, I didn't care about her much until someone told me that she recently got break up and feeling sad about it. I, naive person thought I could help her since I am aware of feelings being rejected, abandoned and not having support. 

I thought I give her support that I didn't and I did what I thought was right, I purposed her with all the encouraging and support words I could think of. I thought I could help during her darkest time but it was revealed that it was a lie, I was played, it was a plan and apparently teacher was also involved, it was harmless prank according to them. I was mocked every day for what I have did.

I been rejected, abandoned, or misunderstood so often, it starts to feel like that’s just who I am.

I have been misunderstood a lot, even laughed off or dismissed when I try to open up whether it be family members, friends or people I thought I could trust. 

Now try to open up feel like begging for some attention, sympathy and 

Open up feels dangerous like giving key of your house and hoping that they won't break in to steal most precious stuff you have.

That's why me and my pride made a pact that we need no help.

It's not that I never went to therapist, I did but things didn't go well there as well, she was using humanistic method while what I really needed was psychodynamic method. Because every time I went there, I always came back with feelings of regret and more vulnerable like why did I even said that. It was not helping me.

Therapist said I need medication but I avoid it and refuse to take it because I am scared to take it. I am scared that I would become dependent of that, I fear that I might overdose myself just like a girl from my city did when she heard that her mom has cancer and she couldn't bear it and kept taking the pill until she died.

Pills are not solution. I doubt that numbing the emotions or balancing brain chemical would solve my problem.

## 18 years to 19 years
I have completed my education till 12th alone, no one is there to cheer me or celebrate me. My parents wouldn't care, they just want me to bring something to table, doesn't matter how but I need to bring else keep bearing their taunts and torture.

Did I mention I no longer get physical punishment? Now I am getting **mentally abused** for things that aren't in my control.

I was healthy kid with healthy body but after the completing my education, all the burden and responsibilities were thrown on me, that quickly deteriorated me both mentally and physically.

And relatives pushed more rather helping me. Saying that it's time to reduce burdens from my parents and taking their responsibility with emotional **guilt trip** that they raised you and took care of you and now it's time to pay back. Wish I could them them how they took care of me but I can't because in the end, they are my parents and a part of me still love them.

I wished to study further but now it's seems like just a dream. An experience that I have been **deprived** of. A feeling that I will never know. It's feel sad to think that I never will know what being college feels like.

Going to class without any strict uniform code. Bunk classes with friends anytime you want. Going and travelling with friends, making trip plans that might never get into action. And making a girlfriend.

To be honest, I never was able to befriend with males, I doubt that I befriend with females let alone girlfriend.

All these I have been deprived of and never will know what it's feel like.

## 20 years to [undefined]
I did everything what parents told, worked at every place my parents told me. From hard working labour to restaurant to shopkeeping but none of them work for me.

Boss and owner always scold me for not being able to do basic things, like how I am supposed to know which wrench is 19 inches when I never knew they comes in different sizes, How I am supposed what that customer regularly eat when I am attending thousands of customers everyday.

They act like I supposed to all these from day one, one even told me that I am not a child to be taught.

Eventually I left those job and now pursuing what I love but struggling there bad as well. Constantly feeling that I am useless because I feel like I am not doing anything, everyone there doing something while I am doing nothing. Feeling alone and out of place. I am working with a community yet I feel like not contributing to anything. Still I am there trying to do something, learn something and meet people but still feeling like I am failing.

I met a girl in the community, I don't know why but I felt good around her, I felt when good when talking to her, I thought I could befriend with her but things went south before I could realise it.

I tried to approach her and express my feelings to be friend with her but she mistook my feelings for love and rejected me for something I never asked.

I might be crazy, stupid, even broken but I am not obsessed person. I wouldn't even dare to purpose something whom I met few days ago. I still don't know why she thought that, maybe I will never know because I messed up everything.
