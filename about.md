# About Me

Hi, I’m Taaheer Labbe.  
I write across screenplays, stage plays, and lyrics, building stories that move between film, theatre, and music.  

## What I Do

- **Screenplays** → cinematic stories that imagine the world beyond what we see.  
- **Plays** → character-driven dramas for the stage.  
- **Lyrics** → songs and albums that connect back to my stories.  

Right now I’m working on:  

- **Orpheus** (screenplay)  
- **Therapy** (play)  
- **She|Her** (8-track album)  

## My Approach

I don’t write with genre labels in mind, I write what feels alive.  
Every project begins with an image, a voice, or a line that won’t leave me alone.  
From there, it becomes a world.  

## Beyond Writing

When I’m not lost in the multiverse of my stories,  
I’m often on stage, acting or managing behind the scenes.  

Sometimes I experiment with FL Studio, shaping music to match the emotions of my words.

And other times, I dive into the technical world of software engineering, exploring how creativity and code intersect.

## For Collaborators

If you’re a filmmaker, producer, or theatre group interested in my work, I’d love to connect.
